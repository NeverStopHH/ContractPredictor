# ContractPredictor
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to predict lease contract outcomes in the retail real estate sector. Using historical contract data, the neural network identifies complex patterns and relationships to estimate the likelihood of a successful lease agreement.

Key Features:

-Implementation of a fully connected neural network using TensorFlow


-Data preprocessing pipeline including outlier handling, feature scaling, and embeddings for categorical variables


-Evaluation based on key classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC


The goal is to demonstrate how neural networks can effectively support leasing management decisions by providing accurate contract success predictions.

Feel free to explore and adapt the model for your own predictive analytics projects.
